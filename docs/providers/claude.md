# Claude

Tracks your Claude subscription limits using the login you already have from Claude Code or Claude Desktop.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Session | 5-hour rolling window usage |
| Weekly | 7-day window usage |
| Fable | Separate weekly Fable limit (model-scoped window from the `limits` array) |
| Sonnet | Separate weekly Sonnet limit (plan-dependent) |
| Extra Usage | Extra-usage credits spent against your monthly cap |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Local spend, as cost, tokens, or both (see below) |

Fable is enabled and always visible directly below Weekly by default. Sonnet stays off until you
enable it in Customize. When Claude reports your plan name, OpenUsage shows it beside the provider name.

## Where credentials come from

Sign in with Claude Code or Claude Desktop; OpenUsage reads the existing login. It checks these sources, preferring one that can read your subscription usage:

1. The macOS keychain entry Claude Code maintains (its source of truth on macOS)
2. `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`)
3. Claude Desktop's encrypted login cache, when no working Claude Code login is available
4. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable

Claude Desktop support is read-only. OpenUsage decrypts its currently valid access token using the
`Claude Safe Storage` item in your macOS Keychain. It never reads or uses Desktop's refresh token, and
never changes Desktop's config, cookies, or Keychain entry. This prevents OpenUsage from invalidating
Claude Desktop's session.

macOS asks once before OpenUsage can access that Keychain item. Background refreshes never open the
password dialog: OpenUsage first asks you to refresh manually, and choosing **Always Allow** makes later
refreshes silent. If Desktop's short-lived token expires, open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login,
then refresh OpenUsage.

A `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — usually a long-lived `claude setup-token` — can run the model but can't read your Session and Weekly limits, and it often lingers in your shell environment. So when a real keychain or file login is present, OpenUsage uses that login for the live meters and keeps the environment token only as a fallback; the Session/Weekly meters no longer go blank just because that token is set. If the environment token is your *only* credential (a headless setup), it's used on its own and the spend tiles still load from local logs.

If one source holds an expired or "locked out" token, OpenUsage falls back to the others — so signing in again with `claude` outside the app is picked up on the next refresh, without restarting OpenUsage. Claude Code tokens are refreshed automatically; rotated tokens are written back only while the ordered login candidates still match the start of the refresh, so a newly added higher-priority login wins. Claude Desktop tokens are never refreshed or written by OpenUsage.

## The spend tiles

Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days are computed **locally**: OpenUsage reads the Claude Code session logs under `~/.claude/projects/` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) itself — no external tools needed. Symlinks are followed, so a projects folder linked into a synced location (say, a Dropbox folder) is read all the same. Claude usage from the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) coding agent counts too: OpenUsage reads pi's session logs under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` (or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`) and folds any Claude usage there into the same tiles and trend, so a Claude sub driven through pi still shows up here. pi records its own per-message cost, so those dollars come straight from pi rather than being re-estimated. Cowork (the Claude desktop app's agent mode) counts too: it writes the same logs into per-session folders under `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`, and OpenUsage scans those as well, so desktop agent sessions show up in the tiles alongside terminal ones. Persisted `claude -p` runs count as well. Runs made with `--no-session-persistence` cannot appear because Claude deliberately writes no session log for OpenUsage to read. Advisor work recorded inside a message is counted once under the advisor's own model; the parent's main-model totals are kept separate, and ordinary iteration details are not counted again. A log's recorded fast or standard speed controls its price; OpenUsage does not infer speed from the event date. Days are grouped in your Mac's local time zone, so they line up with your own calendar. Each period is one tile showing cost and tokens together (`$4.08 · 1.2M tokens`); a day with no usage reads **No data** rather than a misleading `$0.00 · 0 tokens` — the same as every other spend-tracking provider. The live Session and Weekly meters are unaffected. The dollars are estimated from token counts at API rates (that's the ⓘ) using the shared [model pricing](../pricing.md); the token counts themselves are measured. No log data leaves your Mac.

Local spend does not require a Claude OAuth login. If Claude Code uses an API-key gateway instead, the spend tiles and usage trend still load from its session logs; the Claude header shows **Not logged in** because the live Session and Weekly meters still require a Claude subscription login.

## Multiple accounts

OpenUsage discovers separate Claude Code logins in hidden folders directly under your home directory
and folders directly under `~/.config`. Each account gets its own card, limits, plan, and local spend;
another folder signed into the same account contributes to the existing card instead of creating a
duplicate. The account using `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is treated as the default login, even when that
folder lives elsewhere. Cards stay attached to their original account when the default login changes.

Cowork session folders are assigned to the account named by their own Claude state. A separate
Claude Desktop account needs at least one Cowork session identifying its organization and a matching
cached Desktop login; signing into Desktop alone does not create a card. Desktop credentials are
pinned to their organization, so switching Desktop's active organization cannot make a card borrow
another account's usage. If different users share the same organization, its Desktop login is not used
until the owner can be verified. Sessions without a provable owner are left unassigned when multiple
accounts are present. An incomplete session scan temporarily withholds Desktop spend history while a
verified single-account login can still show its live limits. Old Cowork sessions can keep a signed-out
organization visible with a login warning.

Changes to the default Claude Code login are detected within about five seconds; custom folders,
Desktop logins, and new Cowork sessions are checked about once a minute. Existing sessions update on
normal refreshes. The first Desktop refresh may ask for Keychain permission; choose **Always Allow**.
Subscription upgrades or downgrades appear after Claude Code or Desktop updates its saved login
details and OpenUsage refreshes; OpenUsage does not make a separate billing request.

Cards keep their account identity, layout, and menu-bar pins when a login moves between sources or
temporarily disappears. When several accounts share the same email address, their cards use the
organization name instead; Claude's generic email-based organization becomes **Personal**. For
example, **Claude — SUNSTORY** and **Claude — Personal** stay easy to tell apart. Right-click a card
and choose **Rename…**, or change its name in Customize. Extra cards have identifiers such as
`claude@ab12cd34`; the original account keeps the existing
`claude` identifier even when it no longer occupies the default login. In the local API and CLI,
requesting `claude` returns every Claude account. There are no manual Add Account or Remove Account
controls; sign in or out through Claude Code or Claude Desktop instead.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in"** — run `claude` and sign in to enable live subscription limits, then refresh. If you use an API-key gateway, local spend still appears whenever Claude Code has written session logs.
- **"Claude Desktop login found"** — refresh manually and choose **Always Allow** when macOS asks for access to `Claude Safe Storage`.
- **"Claude Desktop login is stale"** — open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login, then refresh OpenUsage.
- **"Re-login for live usage"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — your saved login can authenticate for inference but can't read your subscription limits, because it lacks the `user:profile` access (this is what an inference-only token from `claude setup-token` carries). Run `claude` and sign in again with your Claude account, then refresh; the spend tiles keep working in the meantime.
- **"Updates blocked by Anthropic"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — the usage API is throttling OpenUsage. It keeps the last values from the same login, shows when it will retry, and backs off in the meantime. A different login starts with a fresh cache and cooldown.
- **Spend tiles show "No data"** — OpenUsage found no Claude Code logs in the last 30 days. If your logs live somewhere custom, set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so both Claude Code and OpenUsage look in the same place.

## Under the hood

`GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with the selected OAuth token. Claude Code tokens refresh via `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`; Claude Desktop tokens are read-only and must be renewed by Desktop itself. If a token is expired or revoked, OpenUsage retries with the next credential source before reporting an error.

When the five-hour session window has no usage yet, the Session row shows **Not started** on the trailing label; hover explains that the session begins after your first message.
