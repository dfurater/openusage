# iCloud Sync

**Sync Across Macs** is off by default. When it is on, each Mac writes one versioned OpenUsage history
file to the app's private iCloud container and reads the files written by other Macs signed into the same
iCloud account. A random device ID is kept in the login Keychain so the same Mac continues updating its
existing file after app preferences are reset or the app is reinstalled. There is no folder picker,
pairing code, or separate account.

The file contains normalized daily tokens and spend, model totals, and unknown-model names for sources
that are local to one Mac: Claude, Codex, Grok, and OpenCode. It does not contain credentials, account
limits, raw logs, or provider responses. Cursor's history is already account-wide, so it stays local and
is never added across Macs. Disabling a provider immediately removes its peer contributions from the
combined view and omits it from this Mac's next iCloud write, while its local cached snapshot remains.

OpenUsage combines the valid files in memory and rebuilds Today, Yesterday, Last 30 Days, Usage Trend,
unknown-model warnings, and model breakdowns. The same combined spend rows feed the dashboard, Total
Spend, menu-bar pins, share cards, and the local HTTP API. Both `/v1/usage` and `/v1/limits` read the
same rendered snapshots; the former is the deprecated UI-oriented format and the latter is the
normalized format. Quotas, plans, balances, and provider errors remain this Mac's own values inside
those snapshots. Rows retained in an older peer file are ignored once they fall outside the same
calendar window used by the local history scanners.

This Mac updates its file after a five-minute refresh batch, a manual refresh, or a provider enablement
change. iCloud delivery is eventually consistent, so another Mac can take longer than five minutes to
receive it, especially while offline. Downloaded changes reload immediately when macOS reports them.

## Multiple accounts across Macs

Histories match by **account**, not by card name. Each Mac's private iCloud file records the stable
account and organization identifiers supplied by the provider, so the same account merges into the same
card everywhere, even when one Mac shows it as the main card and another as an extra account card.
These identifiers are stored as supplied, not hashed, but never include an email address, account name,
login credential, plan, or quota.

OpenUsage only combines account history when both Macs identify its owner. If either Mac cannot
identify an account, two cards claim the same account, or an older Mac sends account history without
identity information, that history is temporarily left out instead of being assigned to the wrong
card. Once the account can be identified, its history joins the matching card again. A Codex login kept
in the system keychain proves its identity during its normal successful refresh, so its history starts
syncing afterward without an extra Keychain read or a new permission prompt.

An account you use on another Mac but have no login for here doesn't become a card. If this Mac already
has another enabled, verified account from the same provider, the remote account appears as its own
slice in **Total Spend**, named by its account code ("claude@ab12cd34"). The code is derived from the
account identity; an account that was a Mac's original Claude login can still keep the plain `claude`
card ID there. When you log that account in locally, its verified identity attaches the full
cross-machine history to the correct card regardless of which ID that card has.

Update every syncing Mac together. Older OpenUsage builds reject the entire newer account-aware history
file, including other providers, and report that OpenUsage needs updating. Newer builds can still read
older files, but leave their Claude and Codex histories out because those accounts cannot be identified;
eligible non-account providers from older files still merge on the newer Mac.

Settings lists each valid device file with the time that Mac generated it. To remove a Mac from the
combined summary, turn sync off on that Mac; this deletes its file from iCloud. Turning sync off also
stops that Mac from reading peers and immediately returns every surface there to local-only spend.
Malformed files are ignored and reported in Settings and the app log.

## Development and release setup

Apple requires the iCloud container assignment to be present in the provisioning profile embedded in
the app. OpenUsage uses separate resources so development builds cannot write production history:

- `com.robinebers.openusage.dev` uses `iCloud.com.robinebers.openusage.dev`.
- `com.robinebers.openusage` uses `iCloud.com.robinebers.openusage`.

Create a `MAC_APP_DEVELOPMENT` profile that includes every registered development Mac and a
`MAC_APP_DIRECT` profile for releases. Install the development profile on each included Mac. The
development build automatically selects the newest non-expired profile matching the development
bundle and iCloud container from Xcode's current profile directory or the legacy MobileDevice
directory:

```bash
./script/build_and_run.sh
```

Set `ICLOUD_PROVISIONING_PROFILE=/path/to/profile.mobileprovision` only when you need to override
that automatic selection. An explicit missing path fails the build instead of silently producing an
app without iCloud access.

The release workflow reads the base64-encoded `MAC_APP_DIRECT` profile from the repository Actions
secret `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_ICLOUD_PROFILE`. Keep the original provisioning profiles and signing `.p12`
in a password manager, never in the repository. A provisioning profile contains certificates and
entitlements rather than private keys, but treating it as a signing asset keeps rotation predictable.

To inspect the actual history written by a running build, find the file first and only call `jq` when a
file exists:

```bash
file=$(find "$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents" \
  -type f -path '*openusage*/OpenUsage/History/v1/*.json' -print -quit)

if [[ -n "$file" ]]; then
  jq . "$file"
else
  echo "No OpenUsage iCloud history file found"
fi
```

No file is expected when sync is off, the app is signed without the matching profile, or the first
write has not completed. The Settings error and app log distinguish those cases; the spinner only
appears while an iCloud read or write is actually in progress.
